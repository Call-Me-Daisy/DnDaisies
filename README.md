# DnDaisies-v3

## Overview:
	- Discord bot which utilises Canvas to make and display interactive maps for tabletop games (TTGs).
	- Designed is centered on D&D 5e, but most functionality is generically useful for any TTG.
	- Bot functions utilise Discord's slash-command integration

## General Features:
	- Can host an arena in each and any channel - instances are completely independant
	- Can call multiple commands in quick succession by passing an 'instruction list' to /macro parse
	- Keeps channels clear by both deleting BOT responses and outputting to dedicated thread

## Arena Features:
	- Multiple overlapping layers (including background image)
	- Tokens can be easily colour-coded with any hex-colour (including alpha/opacity)
	- Automatically rebuilds and displays the map whenever it changes

## TTG Features:
	- Versatile numeric diceroller command

## Future Features:
	- Undo command to revert previous command
	- Geometric guides
	- Light/Visibility display
